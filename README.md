## ðŸ“‚ Programs Included

### 1. **NumberPyramid.java**
**Description:**  
Generates a random number between 0 and 9 and prints a pyramid pattern of numbers. The pyramid grows from 1 up to the generated number and then mirrors back.

**Concepts Used:**  
- Nested loops  
- Pattern printing  
- `Math.random()` for random number generation

### 2. **LeftS.java**
**Description:**  
Performs a left rotation on an integer array by a given number of positions. This shifts each element to the left and moves the first elements to the end.

**Concepts Used:**  
- Array manipulation  
- Loops for shifting elements manually

### 3. **Histo.java**
**Description:**  
Prints a vertical histogram (`*`) representing the values of an integer array. Each columnâ€™s height corresponds to the array value.

**Concepts Used:**  
- Nested loops  
- Conditional printing  
- Finding the maximum value in an array
